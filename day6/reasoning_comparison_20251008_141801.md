## Experiment Results

### Direct Answer

**Prompt:** Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 2x + 15

**Tokens:** 852

**Response:**

To solve the equation $3x + 7 = 2x + 15$, we want to isolate the variable $x$.

1.  **Subtract $2x$ from both sides of the equation** to gather the $x$ terms on one side:
    $3x - 2x + 7 = 2x - 2x + 15$
    $x + 7 = 15$

2.  **Subtract $7$ from both sides of the equation** to isolate $x$:
    $x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7$
    $x = 8$

To check the solution, substitute $x=8$ back into the original equation:
$3(8) + 7 = 2(8) + 15$
$24 + 7 = 16 + 15$
$31 = 31$
The solution is correct.

The final answer is $\boxed{8}$.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Prompt:** Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 2x + 15

Please solve this step by step.

**Tokens:** 948

**Response:**

To solve the equation $3x + 7 = 2x + 15$, we want to isolate the variable $x$ on one side of the equation.

Here are the steps:

1.  **Subtract $2x$ from both sides of the equation.**
    This will move all terms containing $x$ to the left side.
    $3x + 7 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x$
    $x + 7 = 15$

2.  **Subtract $7$ from both sides of the equation.**
    This will move all constant terms to the right side, isolating $x$.
    $x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7$
    $x = 8$

**Solution:**
The solution to the equation $3x + 7 = 2x + 15$ is $x = 8$.

**Verification (Optional):**
To check our answer, substitute $x=8$ back into the original equation:
$3(8) + 7 = 2(8) + 15$
$24 + 7 = 16 + 15$
$31 = 31$
Since both sides are equal, our solution is correct.

## AI Analysis

Here's a comparison of the two approaches:

### 1. Which answer is more correct/complete?

Both answers are **correct** in that they arrive at the accurate solution ($x=8$) and include a verification step.

In terms of **completeness**, Approach 2 is arguably more complete because it explicitly states the *reasoning* or *purpose* behind each algebraic operation. It explains *why* a step is taken, not just *what* step is taken. Approach 1 is complete in showing the necessary steps and the final answer, but it assumes the reader understands the rationale behind each step.

### 2. Key differences in the reasoning process

*   **Explicitness of Rationale:**
    *   **Approach 1:** Focuses on *what* operations are performed (e.g., "Subtract 2x from both sides"). The reasoning is implicit or assumed.
    *   **Approach 2:** Explicitly states *why* each operation is performed (e.g., "This will move all terms containing x to the left side."). It adds a layer of pedagogical explanation.
*   **Instruction Adherence:**
    *   **Approach 1:** Follows a "no special instructions" directive, presenting a standard, direct solution.
    *   **Approach 2:** Explicitly adheres to a "solve step by step" instruction by breaking down the process and explaining each step's purpose.
*   **Structure and Presentation:**
    *   **Approach 1:** Presents the solution steps, then the check, and a final boxed answer.
    *   **Approach 2:** Uses numbered steps with explanations, followed by a clear "Solution" heading and an "Verification (Optional)" heading.

### 3. Pros and cons of each approach

**APPROACH 1 - Direct Answer**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Concise:** Gets straight to the point, showing the steps efficiently.
    *   **Clear Final Answer:** The `\boxed{8}` format makes the final answer stand out clearly.
    *   **Efficient:** Good for users who already understand the underlying algebraic principles and just need the solution steps.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Less Didactic:** Doesn't explain the *why* behind each step, which might be less helpful for beginners or those needing a deeper understanding.
    *   **Assumes Prior Knowledge:** Relies on the reader's understanding of the purpose of each operation.

**APPROACH 2 - Step-by-Step Reasoning**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Highly Educational:** Excellent for learning or teaching, as it clarifies the purpose of each step.
    *   **Thorough:** Provides a comprehensive explanation of the solution process.
    *   **Accessible:** Very helpful for beginners or those who need to reinforce their understanding of algebraic manipulation.
    *   **Structured:** Clear headings improve readability and organization.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **More Verbose:** Can be longer than necessary if the audience is already proficient in solving such equations.
    *   **Less Direct:** The added explanations, while beneficial, make it less direct for someone just seeking the answer.
    *   **No Boxed Answer:** Lacks the explicit `\boxed{}` format for the final answer, which is a minor stylistic point.

### 4. When to use each approach

*   **Use Approach 1 (Direct Answer) when:**
    *   The audience is expected to have a basic to intermediate understanding of algebra.
    *   Conciseness and efficiency are prioritized.
    *   The goal is to quickly provide the solution steps and the answer (e.g., in a test, a quick reference).
    *   No explicit instruction for detailed reasoning is given.
*   **Use Approach 2 (Step-by-Step Reasoning) when:**
    *   The audience is learning algebra or needs a thorough explanation.
    *   Clarity, understanding, and pedagogical value are prioritized.
    *   The instruction explicitly asks for "step-by-step reasoning," a detailed explanation, or a tutorial.
    *   The problem is complex, and breaking down the logic of each step is crucial for comprehension.

### 5. Conclusion: which approach worked better for this specific problem

For the specific problem of solving $3x + 7 = 2x + 15$, which is a relatively simple linear equation, **Approach 2 worked better due to its comprehensive nature and explicit reasoning.**

While Approach 1 is perfectly correct and efficient for someone who already understands the process, Approach 2 provides added value by explaining *why* each step is taken. This makes it more robust and universally helpful, especially if the problem were presented in an educational context or to a learner. It not only solves the problem but also teaches the method effectively, fulfilling the spirit of a "step-by-step reasoning" instruction.
